# cs534-final-project : Applying Machine Learning to Understand the Relationship Between Education and Crime

## Overview and Background:

Previous works have shown a clear relationship between various metrics of education spending and crime rates (Lochner et al. 2004, Gonzalez 2015, McClendon et al. 2015). But these approaches were all focused on macro-scale spending and crime data, rather than the direct effects of _local_ education spend on _local_ crime. With the U.S. correctional facilities overflowing and currently allocating more federal funds to crime prevention than education, gaining a better understanding of these relationships is an urgent and important pursuit. To try to better understand how local school districts can most effectively allocate their budgets for greatest crime reduction, we explore local spending effects in this open source code base, taking advantage of two rich datasets:
- **Georgia Bureau of Investigation - Georgia  Uniform Crime Reporting Program**
  - Contains crime data for all U.S. counties by year
  - Covers a range of crimes (violent crimes, theft, etc.) across 2009-2017
- **U.S. Census Bureau - Annual Survey of School System Finances**
  - Contains spend data for all U.S. school districts by year 
  - Covers a range of spending figures from 1992-2008

We invite you to explore the scripts and functions we have written, so you can get a sense of these relationships in the state of Georgia! We provide several pre-written functions in this repo that allow you to isolate the most relevant features and reveal the important relationship between _education spending_ and _future crime_. The machine learning approaches we have implemented in this repo are: Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Lasso regression, and Least Squares. 

We provide scripts for plotting and comparison of modeling performance and feature selection across these approaches.

## How to Use:
Below is a list of the main functions in our repo, and a brief description of what each one does.
