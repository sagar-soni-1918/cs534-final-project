# cs534-final-project : Applying Machine Learning to Understand the Relationship Between Education and Crime

## Overview and Background:

Previous works have shown a clear relationship between various metrics of education spending and crime rates (Lochner et al. 2004, Gonzalez 2015, McClendon et al. 2015). But these approaches were all focused on macro-scale spending and crime data, rather than the direct effects of _local_ education spend on _local_ crime. This is what we explore in this open source code base, and we take advantage of two rich datasets:
- Georgia Bureau of Investigation - Georgia  Uniform Crime Reporting Program
- U.S. Census Bureau - Annual Survey of School System Finances


We invite you to explore the scripts and functions we have written, so you can get a sense of the relationships on a local scale in the state of Georgia!

## How to Use:
